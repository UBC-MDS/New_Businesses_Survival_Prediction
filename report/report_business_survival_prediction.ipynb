    "## Summary\n",
    "This study focuses on forecasting the viability of new businesses in Vancouver by analyzing a range of economic and demographic variables. We utilize data from the City business license registry (City of Vancouver, 2023) and supplementary sources such as Statistics Canada (2023) to assess the impact of factors like location, industry type, and economic conditions on the longevity of businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach involves developing a classification model using logistic regression. This model leverages the aforementioned datasets to ascertain the likelihood of a new business sustaining operations over a two-year period. The effectiveness of our final model was substantiated through its performance on a separate test dataset, achieving an accuracy of {glue:}`accuracy`. Out of {glue:text}`total` test data cases, it accurately forecasted the survival of {glue:text}`pred_correct` businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the model incorrectly classified {glue:text}`false_neg` cases as false negatives, erroneously indicating that certain businesses would thrive when they were actually at risk. These inaccuracies could potentially lead to detrimental outcomes, especially in scenarios involving targeted interventions for businesses. Therefore, we advocate for further research and refinement of this predictive model before its implementation as a tool for policy makers and economic authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The business environment in Vancouver is dynamic, influenced by economic trends, demographic changes, and city planning. Accurate prediction of new business survival is essential for both policymakers and entrepreneurs. The central question of this project is: \"Can we predict the survival of new businesses in Vancouver?\" To answer this, we leveraged data from Vancouver's open data portal, supplemented with economic and census data. Analysis was conducted using Python packages including Pandas (McKinney 2010), Altair (VanderPlas, 2018), and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The primary dataset for this study is sourced from the City of Vancouver's business license registry, which is regularly updated with new licenses, renewals, and terminations. This dataset is enhanced with external data on economic indicators and demographic trends, providing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing business survival in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Our methodology involved developing a logistic regression model to classify businesses as likely to survive or not over a two-year period. We employed various economic and demographic variables from our datasets in the model. The data was divided, with 70% allocated for training and 30% for testing. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics, emphasizing the importance of reducing false negatives due to the high stakes involved in business \n",
    "survival predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results & Discussion\n",
    "Initial analysis of the datasets revealed significant trends and correlations between various factors and business survival. The logistic regression model showed promising results, though the presence of false negatives warrants further investigation and model refinement. Our findings suggest that, with improved accuracy, such a model could be a valuable tool for predicting business viability, aiding decision-making for both entrepreneurs and policymakers."

    "To look at which of the features might be useful to predict the survival status, we plotted the distributions of each predictor from the dataset and coloured the distribution by class (failed to survive more than 2 yrs: green, and survived for more than 2 yrs: orange). In doing this, what we aim at is to omit features of which both the binary classes have similar patterns. In that way, it means that these features do have the power to tell the two classes apart and fit their values into each of them. As illustrated in Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3 (Visualization of Frequency of Numeric Features), there exists a correlation between two classes with the numeric features."
